Title: Unveiling Business Success: Analyzing an E-commerce Website Using Key KPIs

Introduction:
In the competitive landscape of e-commerce, understanding the performance of your website is vital for achieving business growth and success. By analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), valuable insights are gained into various aspects of e-commerce website's impact on businesses. In this analysis, I will explored the significance of specific KPIs and their influence on driving revenue, and helping the business to improve the customer experience on the website.
I carried out this analysis on python's jupyter notebook.

Administrative Metrics:
a. Administrative and Administrative_Duration: These metrics reflect the number of visits and the time visitors spend on administrative pages. Analyzing these metrics allows you to evaluate the effectiveness of your website's organization, navigation, and ease of access to crucial information.

Informational Metrics
a. Informational and Informational_Duration: These metrics measure the number of visits and the time spent on informational pages. Analyzing these metrics helps you assess the relevance and usefulness of your content, ensuring that it effectively informs and guides visitors throughout their purchase journey.

Product-Related Metrics:
a. ProductRelated and ProductRelated_Duration: These metrics provide insights into the number of visits and the time spent on product-related pages. By analyzing these metrics, you can understand which product pages generate the most engagement and adjust your strategy to optimize conversions and increase sales.

User Engagement and Conversion Metrics:
a. BounceRates and ExitRates: Bounce rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave your website after viewing a single page, while exit rate measures the percentage of visitors who leave from a specific page. Analyzing these metrics helps identify pages with high exit rates, enabling you to optimize them for improved engagement and conversion rates.

b. PageValues: PageValues assigns a monetary value to each page on your website based on its contribution to conversions. Analyzing this metric allows you to identify high-value pages and prioritize efforts to optimize them for maximum revenue generation.

User Behavior and Experience Metrics:
a. SpecialDay and Month: SpecialDay identifies visits occurring on special occasions, while Month categorizes visits based on the month. Analyzing these metrics enables you to understand the influence of events and seasonal trends on visitor behavior, allowing you to tailor marketing campaigns accordingly.
b. OperatingSystems and Browser: These metrics provide insights into the distribution of visitors based on their operating systems and browsers. Analyzing these metrics helps optimize your website's compatibility and user experience across different platforms and devices, ensuring a seamless customer journey.

c. Region and TrafficType: Region provides information on the geographical distribution of your website's visitors, while TrafficType reveals the sources of traffic. Analyzing these metrics helps you target specific regions and optimize your marketing efforts based on traffic sources to drive targeted traffic and conversions.

VisitorType and Weekend: VisitorType categorizes visitors as new, returning, or other, while Weekend indicates whether visits occur on weekends. Analyzing these metrics provides insights into visitor loyalty and engagement, enabling you to personalize marketing strategies and nurture long-term customer relationships.
Conclusion:

Analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) is a fundamental aspect of assessing the impact of an e-commerce website on a business. By closely monitoring metrics related to user engagement, conversion rates, user behavior, and customer experience, you can identify areas for improvement and optimize your website to enhance engagement, increase conversions, and ultimately drive revenue. Regularly analyzing these KPIs empowers you to make informed decisions, refine your e-commerce strategy, and maximize the potential of your business in the dynamic world of e-commerce.

I carried out exploratory analysis on the features and also developed a machine learning model for the busines to help them project the revenue from the website.
